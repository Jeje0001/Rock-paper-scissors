# Rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python. The user can play against the computer, and the game keeps track of the scores.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.  
2. Enter either `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` when prompted.  
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.  
4. The result of the round will be displayed:  
   - "You won" if the user wins.  
   - "You lost" if the computer wins.  
   - "It is a draw" if both choose the same move.  
5. Enter `q` to exit the game.  
6. The final scores will be displayed when you exit.
